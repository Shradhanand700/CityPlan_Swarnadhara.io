<!-- Q1 -->
<section class="glass-panel">
    <h2>1. What kinds of problems do we observe in nature? (Iteration, Recursion, Backtracking)</h2>

    <p>
        Nature mirrors computational thinking in surprisingly deep ways. Daily and seasonal cycles
        represent <strong>iteration</strong>, where events repeat consistently to maintain ecological balance.
        Many biological structures—such as trees, snowflakes, and fractals—reflect <strong>recursion</strong>,
        where a pattern repeats itself at smaller and smaller scales. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Backtracking appears in animal behaviour, like when a rabbit explores multiple tunnels,
        returning when a path fails and trying an alternative. This problem-solving technique is nature’s
        way of efficiently searching complex environments.
    </p>

<!-- Q2 WITH EMBEDDED ORDER OF GROWTH CHART -->
<section class="glass-panel">
    <h2>2. How did this course improve your understanding of space and time efficiency?</h2>

    <p>
        This course transformed my understanding of algorithmic efficiency. Earlier, I judged solutions
        only by correctness, but now I understand that the real measure of quality lies in how efficiently
        an algorithm uses <strong>time and space</strong> as the input size grows.
    </p>

    <p>
        I learned to evaluate algorithms using Big-O notation, classify their growth rates, and compare 
        trade-offs between speed and memory usage. This knowledge helps in choosing optimal approaches for 
        searching, sorting, optimization, and data-intensive tasks.
    </p>

    <p>Below is the <strong>Order of Growth Chart</strong> summarizing how different complexities scale:</p>

<!-- Q3 -->
<section class="glass-panel">
    <h2>3. What applications of algorithmic thinking in nature or real-world systems did you find interesting?</h2>

    <p>
        I found swarm intelligence especially fascinating. Systems like ant colonies demonstrate how simple
        agents following basic rules can produce globally optimized solutions such as finding the shortest path.
        Even human systems—traffic flow, economic networks, and epidemic spread—often behave like algorithms.
    </p>

    <p>
        These patterns show that algorithmic thinking is not just theoretical; it drives natural and human-made
        systems at every scale.
    </p>
</section>


<!-- Q4 -->
<section class="glass-panel">
    <h2>4. What did you learn about simplifying problems using computational thinking?</h2>

    <p>
        Computational thinking taught me how to break large, intimidating problems into smaller, manageable parts.
        Techniques like decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm design help structure
        complex tasks into clear steps.
    </p>

    <p>
        This approach is useful not only in programming but also in everyday decision-making, academic work, and
        project planning.
    </p>
</section>


<!-- Q5 -->
<section class="glass-panel">
    <h2>5. What are the most important takeaways from this course?</h2>

    <p>
        The most valuable lessons I learned include understanding algorithm efficiency, recognizing natural
        computational patterns, using Big-O notation, and applying problem-solving frameworks that improve clarity
        and precision. These skills make me a better thinker, not just a better programmer.
    </p>

    <p>
        This course strengthened my analytical mindset and prepared me for more advanced study in data structures,
        optimization, and competitive programming.
